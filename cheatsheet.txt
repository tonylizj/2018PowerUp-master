/robot

  ElectricalConstants
  sets where the parts of the robot are (the ports)
  includes drivetrain, encoders, arm motors, arm solenoids, elevator motors
  presents the size and parameters of the wheels


  NumberConstants
  sets constants used in the robot
  includes pid values, gyro values, elevator speeds


  OI
  binds controller to software that allows control of the robot
  uses port of controller from ElectricalConstants
  assigns buttons to commands


  Robot
  initializes subsystems: drive, elevator



  /robot/subsystems

    DriveTrain
    uses encoder, gyro, pids
    initializes ports of motors, gyro, encoders
    setter methods for the power of the motors
    getter methods for utilizing the encoder (getDistance) and the gyro (getYaw)
    autonomous using pids and commands (distance, speed, angle, acceptable range of error)


    Elevator
    initializes ports of elevator motors
    set elevator speed and direction, or stop elevator


    intake
    declare motors arms
    set speed of arm/clamp movement
    set direction of arm movement



  /robot/commands

    ArcadeDrive
    uses drivetrain to move robot
    binds directly to controller
    reads input from controller and makes robot move


    ClimbUp
    uses elevator subsystem to set motor speed and climb
    used to climb at end of match


    DriveStraight
    uses drivetrain to drive in a straight line for a certain distance


    ElevatorUp/Down/ResetZero
    moves elevator up and down, uses speed in numerical constants
    uses elevator subsystem
    ElevatorDown sets the speed to negative of normal speed


    ElevatorPushForward/Back
    uses elevator subsystem to move the elevator along the rail
    moving the rail back helps robot balance when holding cube
    ElevatorPushBack sets the speed to negative of normal speed


    ExtendUp/Down/Hold
    uses elevator subsystem to control the extender movement, used speed in numerical constants
    makes elevator tall enough to place cube on scale
    ExtendDown sets the speed to negative of normal speed


    GoToHome/Zone1/Zone2/Zone3
    moves elevator to preset elevations
    makes it easier to move elevator to grab elevated cubes or reset to lowest position


    RollOutArms/RollInArms
    uses intake subsystem to move arms in or out
    picks up cubes



    /robot/commands/auto
      
      DriveStraightGyro
      uses drivetrain to move robot forward at a given angle, distance, speed, and margin for error


      TurnGyro
      uses drivetrain to turn the robot a certain angle


      Left/Middle/RightAuto
      command groups for auto paths, separated based on starting position
      uses other commands to automatically perform a series of actions
