ElectricalConstants
sets where the parts of the robot are (the ports)
^includes drivetrain, encoders, arm motors, arm solenoids, elevator motors
presents the size and parameters of the wheels


NumberConstants
sets constants used in the robot
^includes pid values, gyro values, elevator speeds


OI
binds controller to software that allows control of the robot
uses port of controller from ElectricalConstants
assigns buttons to commands

Robot
initializes subsystems: drive, elevator



Subsystems

DriveTrain
uses encoder, gyro, pids
initializes ports of motors, gyro, encoders
setter methods for the power of the motors
getter methods for utilizing the encoder (getDistance) and the gyro (getYaw)
autonomous using pids and commands (distance, speed, angle, acceptable range of error)

Elevator
initializes ports of elevator motors
set elevator speed and direction, or stop elevator

intake
declare motors arms
set speed of arm/clamp movement
set direction of arm movement



commands
arcadedrive
uses drivetrain to move robot
binsd directly to controller
reads input from controller and makes robot move

elevator up/down/resetzero
moves elevator up and down, uses speed in numerical constats
uses elevator subsystem

extend up/down/hold
uses elevator subsystem to control the extender movement
makes elevator tall enough to place cube on scale
hold is for fine movement

elevator pushforward/back
uses elevator subsystem to move the elevator along the rail
moving the rail back helps robot balance when holding cube

rollout/rollinarms
uses intake subsystem to move arms
picks up cubes

climb
uses elevator subsystem to set motor speed and climb
used to climb at end of match

gotozonehome/1/2/3
moves elevator to preset elevations
makes it easier to move elevator to grab elevated cubes/reset to lowerst position


autocommands
drivestraightgyro
uses drivetrain to move robot forward at a given angle for auto

turngyro
uses drivetrain and gyro to get angle that robot is moving in

left/middle/right auto
command groups for our auto paths, separated based on starting position
